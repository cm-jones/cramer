### Coding Style

To maintain code consistency, we use clang-format with the following settings:

- BasedOnStyle: Google
- IndentWidth: 4
- ColumnLimit: 80

Please ensure that your code adheres to this style. You can format your code using clang-format before committing by running the following script:

```sh
chmod +x /scripts/format.sh # If the script isn't already executable
./scripts/format.sh
```

Alternatively, you can set up your editor or IDE to format the code automatically on save. Refer to your editor or IDE documentation for instructions on how to integrate clang-format.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Before you start making changes, we recommend that you install a pre-commit hook via the `scripts/install_hooks.sh` script. This will ensure that each commit is properly built, tested, linted, and formatted.

#### Installing Pre-Commit Hook

1. Make all scripts executable by running the following command in the project's root directory:
   ```sh
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. Run the install hook script:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/install_hooks.sh
   ```
